## 1. Opening (1 min)

```
Hi [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] from GreenLine AI. Thanks for taking the time to chat today!

I know Alex from our team reached out to you earlier - did they give you a quick overview of what we do, or would you like me to start from the top?
```

**If they want overview:**
```
Perfect. In a nutshell, we help home service businesses like yours get more qualified leads using AI-powered outreach. But before I dive into that, I'd love to learn more about your business first.
```

**If they got overview:**
```
Great, so you have the gist. Before I show you how it works, I'd love to learn more about your specific situation.
```

---

## 2. Discovery Questions (3-4 min)

Ask these to understand their needs:

```
1. How are you currently getting most of your leads right now?
   (Google, referrals, Yelp, Angi, thumbtack, etc.)

2. On average, how many leads or calls do you get per month?

3. Out of those, how many turn into actual paying jobs?

4. What's your average job value?

5. If you could wave a magic wand, how many more jobs per month would you want?
```

**Listen for pain points:**
- Inconsistent lead flow
- Low quality leads
- Too expensive (paying per lead)
- No time to follow up
- Competition undercutting

## 3. Transition to Demo (30 sec)

```
Got it. So if I'm hearing you right, [SUMMARIZE THEIR PAIN POINT].

Let me show you exactly how we solve that. I'm going to share my screen - can you see it?
```

## 4. Live Demo (5-6 min)

### 4a. Dashboard Overview (1 min)

```

### 4b. AI Calling Demo (2 min)
```
Here's the magic. Our AI receptionist - powered by Retell AI - answers calls and books jobs for you 24/7.

Let me play you a sample call so you can hear how natural it sounds...

```

### 4c. Results/ROI (2 min)
```
Let's do some quick math together:

- You said your average job is $[X]
- And you want [Y] more jobs per month
- That's $[X * Y] in additional revenue

Our clients typically see a 3-5x return on their investment within 90 days.

For example, [CASE STUDY - similar business type]:
- They were getting 10 leads/month
- Now they're getting 30+
- Closed an extra $15K in the first month
```

### 4d. Differentiators (1 min)
```
What makes us different:

1. We find the leads AND reach out - you don't lift a finger
2. AI works 24/7 - no missed opportunities
3. No long contracts - month to month
4. You only pay for results, not promises
```

```

### 5b. Handle Objections

**"Too expensive"**
```
I hear you. Let's look at it this way - what's your average job worth?

[If $300+ job]: So at $149/month, you only need ONE extra job every two months to break even. Everything else is pure profit.

[If smaller jobs]: Even at $100 per job, you need 1-2 extra jobs to cover the cost. And our clients typically book 5-10+ extra jobs per month.
```

**"Need to think about it"**
```
Totally understand. What specifically would you need to think through?
[Address specific concern]
```

**"Need to talk to partner"**
```
Makes sense. When do you think you'll be able to discuss with them?
I can send over a summary and we can hop on a quick call together if that helps.
```

**"Already tried marketing, didn't work"**
```
I get it - a lot of agencies overpromise. What was the main issue?
[Address their specific bad experience]
Our approach is different because [SPECIFIC DIFFERENTIATOR].
```

### 5c. Close
```
So here's what I'd suggest - let's get you started this week so we can have your first campaign running by [DAY].

I just need a few things to get going:
1. Your go-ahead

3. Calendar link for the calls to book into

Should we get that set up now?
```
